An open source user interface for the cross-chain contract aggregation tool, xSafe.

This interface allows users to **securely**:

-   Deploy smart contracts to different chains with the same address and configuration.
-   Sign multi-sig contract proposals across different chains with only one signature.
-   Execute multi-sig contract transactions accross different chains with only one confirmation.
