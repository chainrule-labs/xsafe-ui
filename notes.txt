Case 1:
	User does not click the "+ Add Argument" button
		- Nothing to worry about, since argumentList.length is 0

Case 2:
	user clicks the "+ Add Argument" button 1 or more times, but does not add the type or argument value
		- This means that argumentList.length is > 0
		- Need to require that the type and value are populated for each, and validated, else setHomeErrorMessage("Invalid constructor arguments.")

When the "+ Add Argument" button is clicked:
	- append an object as shown below
		{
		    id: "{auto-generated uuid}",
		    type: "",
		    value: ""
		}
	- When the type or value for an argument changes, need to update the object at the corresponding index of argumentList
		- The type will be updated via the dropdown
		- The value will be updated via the input
When the "- Remove" button is clicked:
	- Delete the object at the corresponding index of argumentList
